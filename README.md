# CJS
Cormack-Jolly-Seber for analysing age- and sex-specific effects

This repository contains code for CJS models that can be used to analyse both age- and sex-specific effects on survival.

Models are based on JAGS in R.

My aim is to make all the models easy to use, such at users simply input data and specify some information and then run the code.

For specific details about each model, including a description, assumptions, data input etc. see corresponding Wiki pages.
