# Cormack-Jolly-Seber models

This repository contains code for CJS models that can be used to analyse both age- and sex-specific effects on survival.

Models are based on JAGS in R.

Important to note: Many of these models are found in or are edits/extensions of models found in Bayesian Population Analysis: A hierarchical perspective written by Kery and Schaub (2012). It is highly recommended to start with this book if you are beginning to learn how to model with Bayes and conduct complex models as it provides a much more thorough breakdown and explanation.

My aim is to make all the models easy to use, such that users simply input data and specify some information and then run the code.

For specific details about each model, including a description, assumptions, data input etc. see corresponding Wiki pages.
