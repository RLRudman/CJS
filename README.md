# CJS
Cormack-Jolly-Seber for analysing age- and sex-specific effects

This repository contains code for CJS models that can be used to analyse both age- and sex-specific effects on survival.

Models are based on JAGS in R.

My aim is to make all the models easy to use with the aim that other users simply input key information and then the code will do data sorting/editing and run the model.
